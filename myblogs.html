    <h1 class="st">Welcome to My travelling blogs <br><h6><i>Author:JOY</i></h4></h1>
    <p class="pp" id="pp" >Dubrovnik is one of Europe’s most beautiful cities. In fact, it’s so stunning that many Game of Thrones episodes were shot in the city’s Stari Grad (Old Town) because it’s just so gorgeously impressive.

        But what was once a hidden gem that saw a fleeting number of tourists is now a bustling — and expensive — destination.
        
        The cost of walking the medieval walls in Dubrovnik: 200 HRK — roughly $28 USD.
        
        The cost of taking the cable car up to Mount Srd: another 200 HRK.
        
        The cost for a round-trip ticket for the ferry to nearby Lokrum island: also 200 HRK.
        
        As you can see, Dubrovnik is no longer a particularly affordable place. This southern Dalmatian city of 40,000 people swells in the summertime, as hordes of tourists cruise in to trudge through the limestone-blanketed streets of Stari Grad.
        
        It may be one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia, but it is unmistakably a tourist town.
        
        And not just for major tourist attractions. There’s a reason why most locals don’t patronize restaurants very often in Dubrovnik: they’re priced for tourists. Hotels and other accommodation options, such as Airbnb, are also sky-high compared to the rest of the country.
        
        Fortunately, the city has a growing number of affordable hostels so you can enjoy this sunny coastal getaway without breaking the bank (or, at least without breaking the bank on accommodation).
        
        Having spent over a decade backpacking around the planet and staying in hostels, I know a thing or two about what makes a good hostel. Before we jump into the list, here are some things to consider:
        
        
        Best Hostel for Budget Travelers: Petra Marina
        Best Hostel for Location: City Walls Dubrovnik
        Best Hostel for Families: Dubrovnik Backpackers Club
        Best Hostel for Solo Female Travelers: Hostel Free Bird
        Best Hostel for Partying: Old Town Hostel
        Best Overall Hostel: Hostel & Rooms Ana

            While bad things don’t happen often on the road, they can — and do — happen. And as unpleasant as they are to think about, it’s important to be prepared for those situations.

            That’s where travel insurance comes in. For just a few dollars per day, you not only get coverage for emergencies but peace of mind, allowing you to travel confidently and without worry.
            
            While I’ve talked about my favorite travel insurance companies before, today I’d like to delve into a slightly different kind of travel insurance: medical evacuation coverage.
            
            This type of policy kicks in when the worst happens and you need emergency medical evacuation while traveling.
            
            You fall and break your leg on a remote mountain. A sudden natural disaster affects the tropical island you’re visiting. Political turmoil overwhelms the country you’re in. These are all situations when an evacuation might be required.
            
            Yet not all travel insurance companies handle them equally — and many companies won’t actually evacuate you all the way home, but rather to the nearest “acceptable” location.
            
            There is one company, however, that guarantees you get home every time: Medjet.
            
            Medjet is a membership service offering medical transportation that ensures you get all the way home should disaster strike.
            
            But what is a “membership service?” And how do you guarantee you get home should something happen?
            
            In this review, I’ll go over what exactly the company offers, the pros and cons of using it, and its COVID policy to help you decide if Medjet is for you and your trip, budget, and travel style.
            
            Do you even need medical evacuation coverage?
            First off, you’re probably wondering whether you even need medical evacuation coverage. To many, it sounds like overkill. Odds are you’ll be fine, right?
